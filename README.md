# clearnace-system-for-group-assignment
A C++ console application designed to manage and track university student clearance across various departments including libraries, finance, and dormitories.
System Description

# System Description

The application evaluates clearance across five departments: Engineering Library, Digital Library, Finance, Department, and Dorm. A student is considered fully cleared only when all departments grant clearance.

# Implementation

The system is implemented using standard C++ features, including arrays, loops, conditional statements, and a menu-driven interface. All data is stored temporarily during runtime.

# Compilation and Execution
g++ main.cpp -o clearance
./clearance
